		<p>With over 3 years of develpment and testing experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user</p>

		<p>For this reason I devided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily update to ensure that the project is aligining properly with the client's goals. The end product is right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
